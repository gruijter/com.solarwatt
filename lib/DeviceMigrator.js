 * Capability migration for already paired devices. One file, kept identical (apart from the
 * licence header) in com.foxess, com.solarwatt and com.gruijter.powerhour so they cannot drift
 * apart again; the algorithm is com.kia_hyundai's lib/DeviceMigrator.js.
 *
 * Homey orders tiles by the order in which capabilities were added, so a capability slotted
 * into the middle of the list has to be rebuilt from that point rather than appended - or it
 * lands at the bottom of the device page. Values are carried across the rebuild so restored
 * tiles are not blank until the next poll.
 *
 * Never delete a custom capability's definition in the release that drops it from a driver:
 * while a device still carries it, Homey rejects every add/removeCapability on that device
 * with "Invalid Capability" (homey-app-development skill, section 14).
